**tidyquery** runs SQL queries on R data frames.

It uses [queryparser](https://github.com/ianmcook/queryparser) to translate SQL queries into R expressions, then it uses [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) to evaluate these expressions and return results. **tidyquery** does not load data frames into a database; it queries them in place.

## Installation

Install the released version of **tidyquery** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyquery) with:

``` r
install.packages("tidyquery")
```

Or install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/ianmcook/tidyquery) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ianmcook/tidyquery")
```

## Usage

Call the function `query()`, passing a `SELECT` statement enclosed in quotes as the first argument. The table name in the `FROM` clause should match the name of a data frame in your current R session:

```{r}
library(tidyquery)
library(nycflights13)

query(
" SELECT origin, dest,
    COUNT(flight) AS num_flts,
    round(AVG(distance)) AS dist,
    round(AVG(arr_delay)) AS avg_delay
  FROM flights
  WHERE distance BETWEEN 200 AND 300
    AND air_time IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY origin, dest
  HAVING num_flts > 3000
  ORDER BY num_flts DESC, avg_delay DESC
  LIMIT 100;"
)
```

Alternatively, you can pass a data frame as the first argument and a `SELECT` statement as the second argument, omitting the `FROM` clause. This allows `query()` to function like a dplyr verb:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

airports %>%
  query("SELECT name, lat, lon ORDER BY lat DESC LIMIT 5")
```

You can chain dplyr verbs before and after `query()`:

```{r}
planes %>%
  filter(engine == "Turbo-fan") %>%
  query("SELECT manufacturer AS maker, COUNT(*) AS num_planes GROUP BY maker") %>%
  arrange(desc(num_planes)) %>%
  head(5)
```

In the `SELECT` statement, the names of data frames and columns are case-sensitive (like in R) and the names of keywords and function names are case-insensitive (like in SQL).

It is possible to use `query()` with [dbplyr](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org) to query remote database tables (`tbl_sql` objects), but this depends on which database and which backend package (if any) you are using, so results may vary.

## Current Limitations

**tidyquery** is subject to the current limitations of the queryparser package. Please see the **Current Limitations** section of the queryparser README on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=queryparser/readme/README.html#current-limitations) or [GitHub](https://github.com/ianmcook/queryparser#current-limitations).
